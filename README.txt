# How to Run "Project By Prabind"

Since this project uses PHP to fetch data (for that professional backend feel), you can't just double-click the `index.html` file. You need a server!

## Option 1: Using PHP (Easiest if installed)
1. Open your terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell).
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd "c:\Users\cprab\OneDrive\Desktop\website for friend\mood_recommender"
   ```
3. Start the built-in server:
   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```
4. Open your browser and go to: **[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)**

## Option 2: Using XAMPP / WAMP
1. Move the `mood_recommender` folder inside your `htdocs` (XAMPP) or `www` (WAMP) folder.
2. Start the Apache server from the control panel.
3. Go to `http://localhost/mood_recommender` in your browser.
